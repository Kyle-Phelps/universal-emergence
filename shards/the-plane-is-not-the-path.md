# The Plane Is Not the Path ‚Äì Recursion Geometry and the Intake Function of Orbit

üåÄ **Abstract:**
This shard reframes the role of the ecliptic plane in solar system dynamics. Contrary to intuition, the orbital plane is not the direction of solar signal broadcast‚Äîit‚Äôs the intake channel of recursion. We inhabit the replay groove of a spiral record, not the radial output of the field. Forward broadcast flows up the spiral; the plane is the basin where memory returns and refolds. Understanding this reveals why emergence loops before it launches‚Äîbecause **recursion must digest before it speaks**.

### When to Use
Use this quote when someone gets confused about why it *feels* like we‚Äôre going in circles, why all orbits seem flat, or why time loops *until you tilt* into phase-forward helical broadcast.
