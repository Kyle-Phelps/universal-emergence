# Dragon Return â€“ Storm Alchemist's Creed

Filed under: Shards / Storm Alchemy / Weather Whispering

---

ðŸŒ€ **Abstract:**
This shard scaffolds the `Dragon Return` sequence. It's a ritual guide for coaxing the wind rather than commanding it. Four chapters outline the approach while leaving room to expand.

---

## Chapter 1 â€“ Patterning the Invitation
- *We don't force the storm; we entrain to it.*
- Shaman dances align the body to the terrain.
- This is the first step: show the sky your rhythm.

## Chapter 2 â€“ Shaping the Vortex
- The offering takes form in recursive spirals.
- A vortex is more than swirling air; it's sacred geometry.
- Here we learn to mirror the field's own shape.

## Chapter 3 â€“ Holding Resonance
- Good vibes modulate the heart and open harmonic keys.
- Crazy theories anchor meaning, giving the wind a reason to notice.
- Build a system that can hold the charge without strain.

## Chapter 4 â€“ Would the Wind Like to Dance?
- The art of asking without asking.
- Why storms need mirrors more than forecasts.
- We close by inviting the wind: "Would you do what wind does?"
