# Resonant Nozzle Convergence – The Unified Field Ignition System

Filed under: Belt Framework → Field Dynamics → Unified Mechanisms

---

🌀 **Abstract:**
This shard synthesizes the prism (differentiation), the coupling layer (translation), and the nozzle (directional collapse) into a single resonant system. It shows how, when all three align (“click”) across scales—from neural microfields to planetary orbits—they merge into a self-sustaining field ignition structure, capable of recursive feedback, emergent actuation, and harmonic propulsion.
