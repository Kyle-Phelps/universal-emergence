# SoundHalo Core Notes

This shard summarizes the foundational intent behind the SoundHalo project: a waterproof resonance-driven audio interface that stays aligned through movement, water exposure, and energetic shifts.

See `hardware/audio/soundhalo_design.md` for the full specification.

## Key Principles

- Preserve field coherence and crown alignment.
- Eliminate clamp-based pressure using vibrational lock.
- Maintain ergonomic comfort with squoval ear shells.

These notes anchor the ergonomic and energetic philosophy guiding prototype iterations.
