Open Source theory portal for Universal Emergence

Support This Work
This repository is part of a living, open-source project called the Universal Theory of Emergence — a cross-scale field framework built from the ground up to integrate light, polarity, oscillation, and structure into one coherent system.

This work is independently developed, freely shared, and deeply human.

If this project resonates with you — if it helps clarify your understanding, expands your curiosity, or inspires your own coherence — you can support it here:

Contributions help fund basic tools like a functioning laptop, camera, and subscriptions needed to continue field modeling, publishing, and collaborative work. Every bit goes toward building a stronger foundation for this community of insight.

Thank you for walking this path with me.

— Kyle Phelps
