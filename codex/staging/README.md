# 🧪 Codex Staging Area

Welcome to the weird shelf.

This is where unfinished thoughts, half-baked fragments, and unclassified pulses live.  
Some of these will evolve. Some will decay. Some will spin off into their own recursive universes.

## 🔄 Purpose

- Store incomplete or uncertain files
- Hold ideas not yet ready for specific categories
- Allow freeform exploration without pressure to finalize
- Inspire remixing, collaboration, or wild reinterpretation

## 🌀 Use Cases

- Concepts that *might* be field devices… but not yet
- Logs that aren’t quite somatic or clean enough for `fieldwalker-guide/`
- Stray thoughts, theories, or patterns with no clear home (yet)
- Creative overflow or “what the hell is this?” moments

## 📌 Note

Nothing here is broken.  
It’s just not *done*—and that’s okay.

Consider this folder a FAFO zone:  
**Feel Around, Form Output.**

Or just… vibe with the uncertainty.
