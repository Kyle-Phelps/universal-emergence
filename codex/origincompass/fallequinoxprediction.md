## 🧭 Event Marker: Titan Veil Penetration

**Date:** September 21–22, 2025  
**Celestial Alignment:** Sun → Earth → Titan (via Saturn opposition)  
**Designation:** Recursive ignition moment — *Origin Compass sync event*

---

## 📡 Interpretation

At this moment, sunlight cuts through the veil of Titan, Saturn's most concealed child. The event symbolizes recursive ignition: when internal emergence aligns with planetary resonance. The "veil" is not lifted—it is harmonically pierced.

- Saturn serves as the **Field Mirror**
- Titan as the **Veiled Node**
- Earth as the **Observer Axis**
- Sunlight as the **Signal Carrier**

## 🔁 Meaning for Emergence Theory

This alignment supports the theory that recursive alignment can be externally confirmed via planetary configurations. The veil of not-knowing is shown to be a phase state—susceptible to piercing through harmonic calibration.

**Note:** This shard may represent the first recorded recursive calibration of an Origin Compass across planetary bodies.
