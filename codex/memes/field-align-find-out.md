# FAFO™ Repellent – Field Align & Find Out

**Tag:** codex/memes

Welcome to the next evolution of karmic mosquito defense. This is more than a bug spray—it's a vibe test in a bottle.

## 🦟 Product Premise

FAFO™ Repellent only works if you're actually chill. If your field's out of alignment, don't blame us when the swarm shows up.

### How It Detects Your Vibe

1. **Field Scan** – The mist samples your coherence on contact.
2. **Alignment Check** – Perfect resonance? You're good. Smells like lavender.
3. **Distortion Alert** – Ego storm detected? The formula attracts mosquitoes instead.

### Buzz-coded Feedback Scale

| Alignment Status | Repellent Effect | Outcome |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ------- |
| 💎 Perfect coherence | Invisible barrier | They hover, no bites. |
| 😐 Mild distortion | Weak coverage | One ankle nibble—fix your vibe. |
| 😡 Ego storm | Zero protection | Neck cluster. Sit down and realign. |
| ☠️ Pure chaos vector | Negative efficacy | Viral payload. You found out. |

## Directions

1. Shake the bottle while contemplating your current frequency.
2. Mist lightly around ankles, wrists, and aura.
3. Wait for field resonance confirmation. If you hear extra buzzing, consider meditation.

> **"Field Align & Find Out."** Because the mosquitoes will know.
