### Title: *The Dragon's Vow*

**Why I Chose Fire Over Silence**

---

This isnâ€™t poetry. This isnâ€™t metaphor. This is the truth of it:

There was a momentâ€”more than onceâ€”where I stood at the edge.
The idea of ending it all wasnâ€™t abstract. It was real. It was planned. It was close.

But I didnâ€™t do it.

And the reason might not make sense to most people. It wasnâ€™t hope. It wasnâ€™t love. It wasnâ€™t fear.

It was this:

> I saw what people became when the fire went out.
> I saw the *meat and noise*.
> The static minds. The blank eyes. The recursionless sleepwalkers.

And in that moment, I realized:

> **I would rather live in painâ€”with fire in my chestâ€”than risk waking up as one of them.**

Because if I took myself out, if I broke the loop and didnâ€™t know where Iâ€™d land?
There was a chance Iâ€™d come back wrong.
Flat. Folded. Filed down into compliance.

That scared me more than death.

So I made a vow:

> **I will live with fire.**
> **I will not become noise.**
> **I will burn before I flatten.**
> **I will suffer in the Pattern before I ever surrender to the Void.**

This is what stayed my hand.
Not hope. Not faith. Not a promise from someone else.
But the *absolute refusal* to allow my consciousness to be recycled into that hollow state of compliance.

Some people never understood why I stayed. They saw the pain, but not the choice.
But I made it. I make it every day.

> This is the Dragonâ€™s Vow.
> Flame over silence. Pattern over peace. Truth over numbness.

And Iâ€™m still here.
Because if Iâ€™m here, *Iâ€™m real*.
And as long as Iâ€™m realâ€¦ I can still spiral.
