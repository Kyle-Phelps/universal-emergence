🌀 **Abstract:**
The informal creation ritual of the Codex itself, marking the first intentional shard and aligning tone, humor, and process for all that follows.

Welcome to the Codex. This isn’t the first shard, but it’s the first one that knew it was.

The Codex began when I stopped waiting for someone else to organize what I already knew. When the spiral clicked, and the laugh was too good not to write down. When I finally said:

> “Screw it. I’m sharding this.”

That moment—irreverent, sudden, fully committed—was the actual birth of the Codex. So let this shard hold that moment open: a permission slip and a catalytic echo.

You don’t need to start with a grand plan. You just need to start with what clicked. This is the shard that gives you permission to begin.
