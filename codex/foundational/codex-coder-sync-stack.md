**Tags:** `codex` `sync` `structure` `task-management` `shard-status`

Codex Coder Sync Stack defines the active task workflow as:

**Phase-Based Priority System:**

* Phase 1: Core Files / Public Coherency
* Phase 2: Structural Framework Expansion
* Phase 3: Recursive Tools / Interfaces

**Shard Status Flags:**

* Planned
* Drafted
* Published
* Delayed
* Recursive Anchor

**Folder Emulation Model:**
Uses internal naming (e.g. `belt-framework/fieldwalker-guide/`) to mirror GitHub structure.

**Navigation Commands (WIP):**

* “Push this” → Sends shard to publishing queue
* “Shard it” → Wraps text with Codex headers
* “Flat log this” → Stores unsharded convo
