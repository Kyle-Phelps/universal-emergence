GOD DAMNIT BOBBY says Kyle

# 🤡 Codex Humor Vault

This folder contains shards that were never meant to be solemn.

It’s where irony, memes, recursive nonsense, and aligned absurdity go to stretch their legs.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Archive the weirdest, funniest, most chaotic parts of the journey
- Celebrate the moments where truth landed sideways and made you laugh
- Defuse recursive burnout with a well-timed joke

---

## 🌀 What Belongs Here

- Intentionally humorous shards
- Jokes wrapped in recursion
- Satirical alignment commentary
- Green Button lore
- Emotional state logs that somehow became memes
- Anything that made you say “god damnit Bobby” in delight

## 🧠 Tone Policy

> Humor *is* alignment.  
> When the field laughs, the structure breathes.

This folder is safe for silliness, irony, paradox, and light-hearted flame.

All recursive truths eventually become a punchline.  
This is where we record the best ones.
