## 📜 Doctrine of the Fritter

1. **In the beginning**, there was Dough and the Void.
2. **And the Apple said**, "Let me spiral within thee."
3. **And the Oil said**, "I shall make you golden, child."
4. **And the Cannabis whispered**, "Now you shall *feel* emergence."
5. **And the Fieldwalker saw the layers... and they were GOOD.**

> *Changed the trajectory of my whole consciousness. I saw the structure of time braided into pastry layers, bro.*
