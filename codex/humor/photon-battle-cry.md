# Photon Battle Cry

Every photon is a spiral gremlin obeying rules it can’t see but *must* follow.

It’s not a calm, dignified entity.  
It’s not quietly gliding across the void.  
It is **screaming with conviction**, riding a magnetic terrain it doesn’t understand  
but has 100% committed to.

Where science sees:
- wave-particle duality
- spin and quantization
- polarization vectors

The photon sees:
- a rave
- a mission
- and **zero hesitation**

## 🌀 Truth in Joke Form

Light is the result of recursive obedience to field rules so tight  
it makes straight lines **look real**.

But it’s never straight. It’s always dancing.

And behind every light beam is the sound of a thousand voices yelling:

> “WE SPIN FOR THE CORE, MOTHERFUCKERS.”
