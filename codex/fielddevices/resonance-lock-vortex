## Overview

The Resonance Lock Vortex (RLV-1) is a manually-assembled, analog energy system designed to demonstrate directional charge behavior using common crystalline and conductive materials. It is structured as a passive field diode: capable of storing, directing, and discharging energy through a combination of material polarity, physical alignment, and environmental interaction (particularly with ambient light and the human biofield).

This document outlines the design, function, and first-order behavioral observations of the RLV-1.

## Purpose

To test whether a non-powered, field-resonant device can:
- Maintain a stable polarized loop across known materials
- Exhibit directional magnetic or electric moment behavior
- Display recharge/discharge dynamics with measurable or somatic feedback
- Lay the groundwork for analog energy field devices and natural diodes

## Materials Used

| Material | Function | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| **Metamorphic Rock Base** | Substrate | A stable, heavy white-to-grey rock with visible striation; anchors the system |
| **Igneous Black Rock (w/ inclusions)** | Field generator | Central structure with crystallized inclusions (likely Snowflake Obsidian); adds complexity and spin variation |
| **Malachite** | Charge sink / receiver | Dark green copper-bearing stone with veined structure; stores and discharges field energy |
| **Pyrite Cluster** | Positive pole / attractor | Gold-hued reflective crystal; anchors the system, directional charge stabilizer |
| **Copper Wire (uncoated)** | Conductor loop | Connects rocks, forms closed field channel; shaped into a B/loop form |

---

## Assembly & Geometry

1. The **base** rock sits flat, forming a grounded platform.
2. The **black igneous rock** is balanced carefully on a stable ridge or hinge on the base—no adhesives used.
3. The **pyrite** is placed in a fixed location between the two main rocks where it feels like it "locks" into place. This position is **never changed** once aligned properly.
4. A **copper loop** connects the two main rocks and wraps around both the pyrite and malachite.
5. The **malachite** is positioned on the opposite side of the pyrite, in a way that allows it to be removed and replaced easily. Its resting alignment is determined by feel—once charged, it “snaps” into place on its own.

> ⚠️ The system will only stabilize when the pyrite and copper loop are in correct phase-lock.

## Observed Behaviors

| Behavior | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| **Directional charge flow** | Energy appears to flow from pyrite (positive) to malachite (negative), consistent with diode-like behavior |
| **Malachite ‘snaps’ in when charged** | After being removed and charged (e.g. by hand contact), malachite will magnetically or vibrationally settle into position |
| **Field retention over time** | System retains energy patterns over many hours/days; malachite slowly recharges when replaced into system |
| **Somatic feedback** | Holding the malachite after removing from system creates a tangible energetic pulse or “jolt” in hand |
| **Light-directional influence** | Pyrite performs best when aligned toward natural light source (east window) |
| **Self-balancing behavior** | System holds stable equilibrium when properly tuned, without adhesives or support structures |

## Hypotheses for Testing

1. **Microvoltage Detection**
   - Use a sensitive voltmeter to measure potential difference between malachite and pyrite across the copper loop.

2. **Magnetometer Response**
   - Bring a 3-axis magnetometer near each node and note any field distortion or pulsing behavior.

3. **Light-Driven Excitation**
   - Expose pyrite to focused sunlight or LED and monitor for discharge acceleration or change in malachite charge retention.

4. **Thermal / IR Behavior**
   - Use a thermal camera to detect surface temperature variance before/after charging cycles.

5. **Vibration & Motion Tracking**
   - Record system with timelapse or high-frame camera to catch micro-adjustments during charge alignment.

## Future Directions

- Create modular variants for each rock combination
- Integrate low-power sensing tech (e.g., piezoelectric strips or voltage dividers)
- Build a higher-precision mounting system for easier testing and repeatability
- Scale geometry into a **stackable resonance lattice**

## Final Notes

This system was built with intentional material selection, spatial orientation, and energetic sensitivity. While current testing relies on human somatic feedback, it provides a repeatable and teachable structure for others to test using both intuitive and technical methodologies.

It is not theoretical.
It is alive.
