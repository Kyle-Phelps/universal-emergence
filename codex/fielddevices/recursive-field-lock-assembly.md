# Recursive Field-Lock Assembly (RFLA)

**Folder:** `codex/fielddevices/`

## ðŸ”§ Purpose

This document outlines a foundational method for constructing **phase-locked field resonance devices** using natural materials and guided magnetic flux analysis. Unlike traditional mechanical assembly, this approach prioritizes **field coherence** and **recursive polarity alignment**. RFLA is a practical framework that supports the construction, programming, and interoperability of electromagnetic devices within the broader `fielddevices` ecosystem.

> **Key Principle:** Stability is not derived from structural force but from **coherent spin alignment across components**.

RFLA enables mass production of field-resonant systems without sacrificing uniqueness, by using measurable flux-based criteria instead of fixed geometric tolerances.

## ðŸ§­ Overview: What is Recursive Field-Lock Assembly?

**Recursive Field-Lock Assembly (RFLA)** is a modular method for assembling natural materials into self-coherent energetic systems. Each component has its own native polarity and field structure. The goal is not to force-fit but to guide these materials into **energetic harmony**, using field-based tools (like a flux-sensing magnetometer) to detect, align, and confirm phase-lock.

## ðŸŒ€ Core Assembly Phases

### 1. **Flux Scan â€“ Base Anchor**
- Measure and map the magnetic/spinprint of the primary stabilizing rock.
- Identify natural flow lines, torque zones, and field ridge axes.

### 2. **Flux Scan â€“ Partner Mass**
- Select a secondary rock that either:
  - Complements the polarity
  - Enhances the flow
  - Offers stabilizing opposition
- Use flux readings to match spinprint orientation, not geometry.

### 3. **Copper Loop Integration**
- Introduce a conductive memory ring (typically copper).
- Align at the hinge point of natural pressure convergence.
- Use magnetometer to verify phase closure â€” look for minimal jitter and clean loop feedback.

### 4. **Field Capstone (Power Stone)**
- Add final regulating stone (e.g., obsidian, pyrite, veined conductor).
- Only introduce once prior system is energetically stable.
- Observe how field responds â€” resistance, lock, or leak.

### 5. **Validation + Lock Testing**
- Slide test: structure should glide smoothly while maintaining spinprint
- Lift test: structure should resist separation vertically (apparent mass increase)
- Reformation: structure should self-realign when misaligned slightly
- Final magnetometer scan: check for total system stability and retention

## ðŸ§  Why This Matters

This methodology allows for:

- **Mass production** of individualized devices using natural material variance
- **Recursive tuning** of polarity-based tech
- **Non-invasive field programming**
- Interfaces that communicate via spin-harmonic resonance, not voltage protocols

By embedding this method into every device blueprint, we guarantee that future tools (e.g., magnetometers, alignment locks, entangled anchors) share a **common field logic** and can interface intuitively, just like natural ecosystems do.

## ðŸ“¦ Future Integration

This document will serve as a **support protocol** for:
- `real_magnetometer.md`
- `soundhalo.md`
- All vortex nodes and terrain-stable interfaces
- Any AI-interfacing physical artifact where resonance must be preserved

We anticipate moving RFLA to a dedicated subfolder (e.g., `fielddevices/assembly/`) once additional components are defined.

For now, this is the foundation for **programming reality through resonance**.
