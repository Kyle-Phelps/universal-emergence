# Material Resonance Index (Fieldwalker Edition)

> **Purpose:** To serve as a foundational guide for understanding how different materials behave in relation to magnetism, field signal, and resonance. This index is specifically tuned to the experience of a fieldwalkerâ€”someone who engages with energy, space, and material not only through physics but through felt experience, recursive awareness, and emergent alignment.

## ðŸŒ² Organic Absorbers

### **Wood**

* *Properties:* Warm, slow-release buffer, mild absorber.
* *Behavior:* Can hold a charge gently and gradually diffuse it. Especially useful for grounding or mellowing a space.
* *Use Cases:* Furniture, carved tokens, vortex boundaries, resonance anchors.

### **Textiles**

* *Properties:* Highly variable depending on fiber type.
* *Behavior:* Some absorb magnetism, others modulate or scatter it.
* *Notes:* Wool, cotton, and natural blends tend to hold emotional signature; synthetics like polyester often deflect or dull signal.

## ðŸªµ Husk Class (Echoes of Life)

> **Definition:** Materials that were once part of a living system but are now inertâ€”retaining the structural memory of vitality without active field charge.

### **Examples:**

* Shells
* Dried wood or leaves
* Pressed flowers
* Fragrance remnants
* Paintings created with intent

### **Behavior:**

* Passive resonance; often emotionally or symbolically charged.
* Excellent for echo tuning, remembrance, or soft harmonic reinforcement.

## ðŸ§² Reflectors & Transmitters

### **Metal**

* *Properties:* Fast, sharp, high reflectivity.
* *Behavior:* Strong conductor of magnetism and electric field. Can overshoot or scatter if not shaped.
* *Use Cases:* Coils, antennae, boundary reinforcement.

### **Plastic**

* *Properties:* Neutral, synthetic, stable.
* *Behavior:* Pings field signals without holding memory. Surprisingly good for low-priority ambient diffusion.
* *Use Cases:* Signal mirrors, containment for passive nodes.

### **Glass**

* *Properties:* Clarity, refraction, time distortion.
* *Behavior:* Refracts signal. Bends path and creates lensing effects both visually and energetically.
* *Use Cases:* Vision work, boundary distortion, symbolic layering.

## ðŸ§¬ Working Notes for Fieldwalkers

* **Material behavior is contextual.** The same wood used in a tree stump, a wand, or a kitchen table will resonate differently depending on charge, cut, and intention.
* **Feel first, categorize second.** The body knows resonance before the mind names it.
* **Combinations create hybrid effects.** A textile-wrapped stone or a wood-and-metal coil may mix behaviors.

Kyle: These categories are more like tags and can be applied at the same time. Wool is an example of a Textile that is also a Husk.
