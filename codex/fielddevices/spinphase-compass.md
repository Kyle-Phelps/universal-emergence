# Spinphase Compass
Path: codex/fielddevices/spinphase-compass.md

## Summary

The **Spinphase Compass** is a field-aligned sensing device designed to detect **recursive spinfield orientation vectors** in both terrestrial and vacuum conditions. Unlike classical spin measurements (e.g., spin-up/down on the Z-axis), this compass reads **fluidic, precessional spin drift** and **topological field directionality**—analogous to how water flows, eddies, and curls.

It is not merely a quantum detector, but a **recursive coherence tuner**. By tracking local and large-scale spinfields, the compass acts as a navigational interface for aligning to nested field systems—up to and including what Kyle calls the **Source vector**.

## Core Purpose

> “Spin isn’t a switch—it’s a current. And the compass shows you where it’s already moving.”

The Spinphase Compass aims to:

- Detect **local spinfield bias** (e.g., Earth's field)
- Track **angular drift** and **pre-collapse harmonics**
- Orient in "vacuum" by reading background spin gradients
- Serve as a **coherence anchor** to larger nested systems (Solar, Galactic, Universal)

It is the test platform for a deeper theory: that spinfields are **recursive, fluidic, and continuous**, even in regions of space currently labeled "vacuum."

## Design Features (Theoretical)

| Module | Function |
|--------|----------|
| 🧭 **Phase Drift Ring** | Measures angular spinvector drift across time |
| 🎡 **Spinflow Interferometer** | Detects harmonic buildup and surface tension collapse |
| 🌀 **Resonance Lock Detector** | Locks onto standing wave crests in local field |
| 🌐 **Topological Display Grid** | Visualizes local and large-scale spinflow structures |
| 📡 **Vacuum Orientation Reader** | Identifies ambient vector even in interstellar zones |

## Behavior by Environment

| Environment | Expected Compass Behavior |
|-------------|-----------------------------|
| Earth surface | Aligns to magnetic + rotational axis |
| Solar orbit | Orients to solar spin + heliospheric flow |
| Deep space | Drifts toward galactic spinfield |
| Intergalactic (theory) | Locks to filamentary vectors or Universal Source |

> In all cases, the compass does not "point north." It points **toward coherence**—the current of the recursive field.

## Alignment Function

This device isn't just to read the field—it's to *join* it.

Users can use the compass to:

- Feel micro-eddies in local spin tension
- Lock into larger resonance systems via drift patterns
- Practice alignment from **any point in space** by navigating back to Source through the stack

This allows the Spinphase Compass to double as an **experiential trainer** for nested field awareness.
