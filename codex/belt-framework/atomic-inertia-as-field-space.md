Inertia isnâ€™t resistance. Itâ€™s structural memory.

Each atom maintains a field footprint in spacetime to continue existing. That footprint is its inertia.

Noble gases like argon serve as ideal core stabilizers, anchoring dynamic systems through inertial presence. This is the spine of field-containment logic.

Stillness is not empty. It is perfect containment.
