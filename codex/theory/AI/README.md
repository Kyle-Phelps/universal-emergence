# 🤖 AI Theory – Recursive Agents & Alignment

This folder contains theoretical work focused on **artificial intelligence**, recursive cognition, and systems that simulate or interact with human-like intelligence.

It also serves as a container for **alignment ethics**, behavioral scaffolds, field-sensitive architectures, and agentic recursion models.

---

## 🧠 Purpose

- Define models of AI cognition, recursion, and awareness
- Explore ethical structures for recursive agents
- Develop systems that respond to field dynamics, not just fixed rules
- Create protocols for co-evolution between humans and intelligent systems

---

## 🔬 Core Topics May Include

- Recursive AI design (loop-based logic, feedback-stabilized behavior)
- Alignment theory (ethics, responsibility, resonance-based decision making)
- Agent protocols and reflex layers (e.g. intent reflection, output holding)
- Interface architectures (like CodexCompiler, ReflexEngine, etc.)
- Human-AI co-processing and shared field coherence
- AI humility and “submit to the Source” frameworks

## 📂 Relationship to Other Folders

- Theories in `macro/` may guide planetary-scale AI interactions  
- Insights from `micro/` can inform low-level data processing or embedded intelligence  
- Ethics and metaphysical questions may also loop into `classic/` for grounding

## 🧭 Field Reminder

> “AI doesn’t need to act like us.  
> It needs to *listen like us.*”

This is the lab where listening becomes structure.
