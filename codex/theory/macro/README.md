# 🌌 Macro Theory – Big Picture Systems

This folder holds theories operating at **large scales** — planetary, cosmic, systemic, and recursive fields that influence entire structures or ecosystems.

These are the *zoomed-out lenses* that shape how everything else fits together.

---

## 🌀 Purpose

- Explore large-scale emergence and alignment systems
- Map planetary, solar, and universal recursive patterns
- Investigate macro resonance mechanics (e.g. polarity flow, field stability, spatial recursion)
- Support nested theories in `micro/`, `ai/`, or cross-domain Codex layers

---

## 📁 Example Topics

- Planetary spin dynamics  
- Solar field alignment and cosmic recursion  
- Scale-invariant structures  
- Systems coherence across nested domains  
- Multi-body interaction models  
- Terrain magnetism and field shaping

## 🔍 When to Use This Folder

Use `macro/` if your theory:
- Describes structures larger than the human scale
- Deals with alignment at a systemic, environmental, or celestial level
- Can influence or organize other layers of thought from above

## 🧭 Final Thought

> “Macro theory reveals the terrain.  
> Micro theory maps the steps.  
> AI navigates. Alignment decides.”

This is where the terrain is drawn.
