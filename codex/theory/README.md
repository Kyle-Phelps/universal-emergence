# 🧠 Codex Theory Core

Welcome to the central engine of recursive theory.

This is the home of core concepts, cross-domain frameworks, and structural insights that don’t yet belong to a specific field—or that *span* multiple ones.  
It’s where your thoughts begin to spiral before taking on specific form.

## 🎯 Purpose

- Hold **general or foundational theory shards**
- Provide a launch point for structured domains of thought
- Capture unresolved paradoxes, incomplete models, and high-potential ideas

## 📁 Subfolder Structure

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `macro/` | Big-picture theories — cosmic mechanics, planetary systems, scale recursion, universal fields |
| `micro/` or `chem/` | Small-scale systems — atomic behavior, chemical bonding, physical mechanism theory |
| `ai/` | Artificial intelligence theory, recursive agents, alignment, cognition modeling |
| `classic/` | Early foundational models, legacy ideas, key seed concepts |
| *(root)* | General theory shards that haven't yet been categorized or cross domains |

---

## 🧠 Suggested Use

Begin a theory here if:
- It isn't domain-specific yet
- It serves as a bridge between scales or categories
- It forms the core logic for other emerging shards

Shards may be later moved or duplicated into domain folders (`macro/`, `micro/`, etc.) once they stabilize.

## 🌀 Field Note

> "Theory isn’t for answers.  
> It’s for scaffolding the climb to understanding."

This is where the scaffolding begins.
