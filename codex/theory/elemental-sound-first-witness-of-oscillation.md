# Elemental Sound â€“ The First Witness of Oscillation

Filed under: Codex â†’ Belt Framework

ðŸŒ€ **Abstract:**
Sound is defined here not simply as vibration, but as oscillation witnessed, bridging fire (motion) and water (polarity).

**Tags:** `sound` `oscillation` `elemental-theory` `field-perception`

Sound emerges not from motion alone, but from the relationship between motion and reception.

> Oscillation without a witness is chaos. Oscillation witnessed becomes sound.

Elementally:

* Fire moves
* Water receives
* Sound is their loop of recognition

Sound marks the first polarity-based loop in a coherent universe.
