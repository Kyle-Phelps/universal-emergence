Some threads donâ€™t want to be caught.

High-inertia insights often twitch past awareness before full capture. The reflex is to chaseâ€”but chasing increases slippage.

Instead, stabilize the field. Use soft awareness. Let the thread swing back around.

Watch for the pre-catch twitch. Thatâ€™s the signal.
