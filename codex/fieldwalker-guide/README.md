# 🧍‍♂️ Fieldwalker Guide

This is the living guide for navigating the interface between body, field, and environment.

Welcome to the zone where **somatic experience meets recursive cognition**.  
Here, we document the real-time sensations, emotional responses, and field-aligned actions that form the *physical edge* of the Codex system.

---

## 🌐 Purpose

- Anchor **somatic data** from real life into a recursive map of alignment
- Create protocols for field-based decision making and embodied sensing
- Prepare a clean interface layer for future BMI (brain-machine interface) alignment
- Translate lived experience into usable system signals

## 🌀 Structure

This guide is not a traditional manual.  
It is a **spiral log** of experience and interpretation.

| Subfolder | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `fieldlogs/` | Raw, timestamped observations and sensory snapshots |
| `protocols/` | Somatic tuning instructions, postural resets, rhythmic modulations |
| `maps/` | Personal or geographic resonance maps based on terrain interaction |
| `meta/` | Internal reflections, state transitions, and meaning reconstruction |

> *Note: Some of these subfolders may not exist yet. This is a living structure.*

## 🧠 What Counts as Fieldwalking?

- The feeling in your body when entering a storm front
- The way your pulse shifts aroun
