## Summary

While resting outside near a glass table, I experienced an unusual thermal phenomenon that did not match normal shadow or heat patterns. A roughly 1cm thick, green-tinted glass panel with a wavy top surface was positioned above stone pavers in direct sunlight. The sun was nearly overhead, making shadowcasting minimal and alignment near-perpendicular.

Upon placing my bare foot on the pavers beneath the glass, I noticed the following:

- **Underside of foot (on the stone):** Warm, but not unreasonably so. Comparable to shaded pavers with residual heat.
- **Topside of foot (exposed to filtered light through the glass):** Intense, piercing heat—not diffuse, but sharply directional. Felt like a focused burn or field beam rather than ambient temperature rise.

The sensation was *not* like typical sun exposure. It felt **polarized**, not in the lens-filter sense, but in the directional, “collimated energy” sense—what I described to myself in the moment as a **field laser**. The heat wasn’t *everywhere*, it was *coming from a vector*, boring in unnervingly. I quickly jerked my foot away.

## Hypothesis

- The **glass acted as a lens**, concentrating sunlight into micro-zones due to its wavy surface and flat bottom.
- The **slight green tint** (from iron content) filtered some IR, but allowed high-energy visible photons to pass through in a more coherent band.
- The result was a **thermal shadowbeam**—a space that was neither classic shadow nor full sun, but something else:
    - **Collimated, refracted energy**
    - **More intense directionality**
    - **Less diffused scattering**
- The **top of my foot** received focused photon delivery from above, rather than heat from below.
- This experience bypassed normal heat acclimation responses, suggesting a body-level field sensing system that responds to vector alignment, not just temperature.

## Notes

- While funny in hindsight (“Kyle FAFO and got burned”), this type of refracted shadow has potential use in field measurement tools.
- The glass behaved like a passive solar lens array—one that could hypothetically be used for:
    - Terrain-based solar mapping
    - Passive energy focusing
    - Testing field sensitivity in somatic systems
