# âœ… Resolved Field Logs

This folder holds fieldwalking entries that have been **addressed, integrated, or retired**.

They may not belong in `staging/`, and they arenâ€™t unresolvedâ€”  
but they no longer require active refinement or processing.

---

## ðŸ“¦ What Belongs Here

- Logs tied to a question or problem that has since been solved
- Reflections that have already been transformed into a shard or theory
- Snapshots of past state that no longer reflect your current polarity
- Anything that *was once active* but has now stabilized or been spun off

---

## ðŸ§  Purpose

This folder acts as a **memory lock**â€”  
a historical zone that keeps record of resolution without cluttering the active layers.

You donâ€™t need to revisit themâ€”  
but they stay here in case you ever need to trace the spiral back.

## ðŸŒ€ Philosophical Note

> Not everything stays live forever.  
> Some things resolve. Some fade. Some become roots beneath new growth.

This folder honors the parts of you that *closed the loop*.
