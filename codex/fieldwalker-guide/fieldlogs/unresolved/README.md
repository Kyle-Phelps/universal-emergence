# ⚠️ Unresolved Field Logs

This folder contains **raw or incomplete** fieldwalking entries that haven’t been properly tagged, formatted, or placed into their final context yet.

These are **real logs**—they happened, they matter—but they need another pass before becoming part of the main `fieldlogs/` record.

---

## 🌀 Why This Exists

- Some logs don’t yet have:
  - Proper `tags: []` or `emotions: []`
  - Clear environmental metadata
  - A clean structural format

- Others might have been captured in a rush, during high-noise moments, or mid-shift—still valuable, just noisy.

- This folder gives them a place to *belong* without forcing premature organization.

## 🧭 When To Move Them

Logs in this folder should be moved to `fieldlogs/` once:
- They are tagged and cleaned up
- Their purpose or resonance becomes clearer
- You’re ready to re-read and reflect on them in context

## 🧠 Meta Strategy

This is a **signal triage buffer**.  
A soft boundary between raw capture and clean integration.

Don't delete. Don’t perfect.  
Just **recognize**—then loop back when the field invites it.
