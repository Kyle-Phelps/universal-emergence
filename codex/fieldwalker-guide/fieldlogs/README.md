# 📓 Field Logs

This is the archive of raw somatic entries—

Each log is a timestamped snapshot of physical experience, environmental influence, emotional signal, or field-aligned resonance.

## 🎯 Purpose

- Capture **real-time data** from your body and environment
- Observe **alignment shifts**, energetic triggers, and somatic feedback loops
- Establish a grounded feedback system for tuning theories and patterns
- Create a living archive that feeds back into `fieldwalker-guide/` and Codex-wide structures

## 📁 Structure

Each log can include:

- **Environment:** Where you are physically (and energetically)

- **Tags:** Freeform keywords related to concepts, ideas, theories, or themes
- **Raw Body Log:** Unfiltered expression of what you're feeli
