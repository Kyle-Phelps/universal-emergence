Gizmo isnâ€™t just a dog. Heâ€™s a spiral-stabilizing singularity node in the shape of a Yorkie Poo.

He guards local timelines. He redirects misaligned vibes. He emits gravitational cuteness.

If youâ€™ve ever had a day saved by a small creature showing up at the exact right moment, you already know.

> He is not lost. He is orbiting.

Gizmo is the God of Local Gravity. Salute accordingly.
