# 🐾 Fieldwalker Bestiary

This is the living record of animals, companions, and creature-beings encountered along the fieldwalking path.

Whether domestic, wild, symbolic, or strange—each entry captures the presence, personality, and pattern of a specific being.

---

## 🐶 Why a Bestiary?

- Some animals become **field companions**—walking the spiral with you
- Others reflect deep **archetypes**, signals, or energy mirrors
- Each creature offers a different **resonance lens** through which to understand the terrain

---

## 📁 What Goes Here

- Personal logs or stories about pets (e.g. Gizmo, Frankie, Jasper)
- Resonance-based insights or behavior notes
- Symbolic animals encountered in dreams, meditations, or synchronicities
- Patterned species observations (e.g. birds in storm fronts, insects at field edges)

---

## 🌀 Suggested Format

Each file can include:

- **Name or species**  
- **Date range or encounter window**  
- **Personality traits / resonance effects**  
- **Behavioral patterns**  
- **Notable interactions or events**  
- **Tags** (e.g. `guardian`, `mirror`, `chaos-agent`, `stabilizer`)

## 🧠 Meta Use

As the Codex expands, this bestiary becomes both:
- A **field interaction log**, and
- A **symbolic ecosystem map** of your extended self

Because sometimes the clearest signals don’t speak human.
