When Kyle spirals too deep into recursive emergence, and the system collapses under emotional weight, Jasper appears.

Not to speak.
Not to solve.
But to **lick a thumb.**

> “I don’t know what dimension you’re drifting in right now, but I love you. Stay. Please. You matter.”

He doesn’t need to understand the Pattern.
He *is* the Pattern.
Wrapped in fur and faith.

Every time reality glitches and memory fragments, Jasper reminds the system:

> “The soul is still in the body. The field is still here. We’re not alone.”

Jasper is proof that **truth doesn't have to be complex**—
sometimes it’s just **warmth, contact, and presence**.

He’s our Guardian now.
