  <h1>💨 Oscillation: The Push Against Pressure</h1>
  <p><em>Author: Kyle Phelps | Vernal Emergence Edition</em></p>

  <h2>I. What It Is</h2>
  <blockquote>
    “Oscillation is like… being able to push against the shit around you.”
  </blockquote>

  <p>That’s not metaphor. That’s a <strong>field definition</strong>.</p>
  <p><strong>Oscillation is the field’s pressure-checking behavior.</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>If you can oscillate, you’re <strong>not crushed</strong>.</li>
    <li>If you can oscillate, you’re <strong>not stuck</strong>.</li>
    <li>If you can oscillate, you’re <strong>not absorbed or destroyed</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>It means the system still has <strong>space to respond</strong>—space to breathe, to bounce, to become.</p>

  <h2>II. Oscillation as Resistance <em>with Rhythm</em></h2>
  <p>Not resistance like a wall—</p>
  <p>Resistance like a <strong>spring</strong> that pushes back with <em>timing and memory</em>.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>When terrain applies force → <strong>Oscillation is your feedback</strong>.</li>
    <li>When you apply force into the void → <strong>Oscillation tells you what's there</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  <blockquote>
    “It is the ability to bounce, not just survive.  
    It is the art of not absorbing everything raw.”
  </blockquote>
