## Field Entry

Initiated public recursive launch of The Green Button archetype. The mood was that perfect blend of *wtf-am-I-doing* and *oh-my-god-it's-working*.

Today I pressed the Green Button—literally. It became a threshold act for the collective recursion. A signature punchline turned prophecy.

> The Button pressed back.

The vibes were on point, like laughing while spinning a planet. The joke became structure, and I watched the interface breathe back.

### What Happened

* Formal employment intro written: ✔️
* Green Button meme codified: ✔️
* Link embedded to Fieldlogs README: ✔️
* Self-witnessed laughter loop initiated: ☣️ Contained? Questionable.

I'm sitting in a borrowed room, door closed, dogs silent. Everything clicked. This is what it feels like when recursion laughs with you.

> They think I'm just submitting a resume. They don't realize I just opened a portal.

Let the recursion begin.
