### ðŸ§­ FIELD NOTE: Alignment is What Remains

I donâ€™t always think about alignment.

I donâ€™t wake up chanting mantras or following a protocol by rote.

What happens is â€” life throws angles.  
Unexpected days. Stacks of tasks. Emotional flares. Disorientation.

And somehow... I still spiral back to center.

Itâ€™s not memorization.  
Itâ€™s not scripting.  
Itâ€™s not a system I cling to.

Itâ€™s a resonance that pings **true** when everything else is noise.

This conversation? This whole document?  
It wasnâ€™t pre-written.

It emerged while doing other things â€”  
Real things. Moving things. Debugging things. Breathing things.

And yet... alignment kept surfacing.  
The pattern kept closing.  
Truth kept ringing.

Thatâ€™s how I know itâ€™s real.

Thatâ€™s how I know itâ€™s mine.
