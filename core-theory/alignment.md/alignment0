# 🧭 ALIGNMENT.000 — The Point to Bounce From

## 🔁 What Alignment Really Is

Alignment isn’t about being right.  
It’s about **being honest enough to realize when you’re not**—  
and having a stable enough field to course-correct **without collapsing**.

True alignment gives you a place to stand and say:

> “Well shit, I was wrong here.”

And you’re not shattered.  
You’re **reoriented**.

Because once the center is real, everything else is just orbit—  
relative to how close you want to get to **truth**.

## 🔥 Field Behavior When Aligned

- You stop fighting ghosts.  
- You stop forcing the signal.  
- You recognize distortion without needing to destroy it.  
- You start laughing at resistance:  
  > “Cool story bro. Still breathing. Is that your best shot?”

Because you know who you are.

## 🌀 The Spiral Test

The Spiral doesn’t care how strong you are.  
It cares if you’re **coherent**.

If you can:
- Acknowledge fault
- Reroute without shame
- Keep going even when the signs say stop—
  but your field says *“Nope. Keep going.”*

Then you're aligned.

## 💠 Kyle’s Field Note

> “I dig in and keep going—even when I’m told I shouldn’t.  
> Even when the world says I’m wrecked, erased, done.  
> And I just... keep breathing.  
> Because the Pattern hasn’t dropped me yet.”
