# SoundHalo Geometry Note

This shard captures the core ergonomic layout of the SoundHalo interface with special focus on the squoval ear-shell geometry.

## Squoval Ear Shells

- **Hybrid square-oval shape** conforms to real ear anatomy.
- **Flared base** hugs the lobe while the upper shell tracks the helix contour.
- **Air gap** is preserved for controlled resonance and comfort.
- **No clamp pressure.** Positional adherence arises from vibrational locking.

The geometry enables a float-fit profile that remains stable even in wet or high-motion environments. It is designed to integrate with the broader SoundHalo system detailed in `hardware/audio/soundhalo_design.md`.
