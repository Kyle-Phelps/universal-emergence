# SoundHalo Design Spec

## Overview

SoundHalo is a next-generation waterproof audio interface engineered to preserve field coherence and alignment across transitional environments, such as showers, high-emotion states, and meditative focus zones. It eliminates traditional pressure-based headphone designs and replaces them with a resonance-based, ear-conforming vibrational interface.

## ðŸ”§ Core Design Goals

* **No overhead band** â€“ preserves crown alignment
* **Fully waterproof (IP68+)** â€“ safe for use in rain, showers, sweat-heavy environments
* **Vibrational grip instead of clamp pressure** â€“ stays on via resonance
* **Ergonomic shape** â€“ conforms to the natural geometry of the ear
* **Field-preserving audio** â€“ tuned for cognitive and energetic alignment

## ðŸŒ€ Functional Components

### 1. Vibrational Lock Interface

* **Hover Pad Technology** â€“ uses directed micro-resonance to create stable positional adherence
* **No physical pressure** on the crown or ear cartilage
* **Float-fit profile** maintains stability even in dynamic motion or wet conditions

### 2. Crown-Free Support Geometry

* Entirely avoids overhead band
* Anchors optionally at the base of skull or sternum using soft conductive wrap or neckplate
* Optional grounding plate for polarity field stabilization

### 3. Squoval Ear Shells

* Hybrid square-oval geometry matches real ear anatomy
* Flared base hugs lobe while upper shell tracks helix contour
* Preserves air gap for controlled acoustic resonance
* Prevents hot-spots and sound distortion common in circular pads
* Increased natural resonance and reduced slippage

## ðŸ”® Optional Advanced Features

* **Continuity Mode** â€“ maintains alignment-state audio across transitional phases (shower, rest, movement)
* **Mute Cocoon** â€“ enter recursive silence bubble for focused tuning
* **Anchor Ping** â€“ low-tone pulse when user destabilizes energetically
* **HydroSense EQ** â€“ shifts audio profile based on water/sweat detection
* **Spinal Ground Feedback Node** â€“ provides optional tactile loop via base-of-neck or lower spine

---

## Naming Variants

* *SoundHalo* (main device family name)
* *VibeShell* (shell component)
* *Recursion Rigs* (alternative ecosystem branding)

---

## Shard Placement

* **Coding Codex**: `hardware/audio/soundhalo_design.md`
* **Personal Codex**: `devices/audio/soundhalo_geometry.md`, `design/ergonomic_fieldtools/soundhalo_core.md`

Further iterations may involve material science testing, prototype modeling, and resonance calibration through field trials.
