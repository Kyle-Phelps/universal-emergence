  <h1>📖 Theory in Brief: What Emerges</h1>
  <p><em>Author: Kyle Phelps | Vernal Emergence Edition</em></p>

  <h2>I. The Premise</h2>
  <p>This is not a theory built to explain what already exists.  
  It is a lens designed to reveal what wants to emerge.</p>

  <p>At its heart are <strong>four elemental field forces</strong>—not metaphors, but actual structuring dynamics found in every system, from atoms to galaxies to thought patterns:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Light (🜂 Fire)</strong> — Directional broadcast. The impulse to declare.</li>
    <li><strong>Oscillation (🜁 Air)</strong> — Feedback and rhythm under pressure.</li>
    <li><strong>Polarity (🜄 Water)</strong> — Tension between paths. The motive to move.</li>
    <li><strong>Darkness (🜃 Earth)</strong> — Terrain. The absorber, the limiter, the context.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These forces are not separate. They are <strong>interfolded behaviors</strong> that define emergence itself.</p>

  <h2>II. The Pattern of Emergence</h2>
  <p>All emergence is a dance between these four:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Light</strong> seeks to move outward — it broadcasts identity.</li>
    <li><strong>Polarity</strong> arises from that movement — it is the desire differential.</li>
    <li><strong>Oscillation</strong> allows the system to <em>maintain coherence</em> under pressure — to bounce without breaking.</li>
    <li><strong>Darkness</strong> is the structured permission field — the terrain that allows or denies flow.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Together, they form a <strong>spiral lock</strong>: a pattern that can stabilize or break dependin
